# Assured: Adaptable Online Training

Assured offers a versatile online training program with various module types tailored to meet different needs.

## Core Modules
Our core modules establish a minimum standard expected of researchers and professional staff when accessing and handling sensitive data. Completing these modules grants researchers a standardized accreditation recognized across Research Data Centres (RDCs) in Germany.

## Supplementary Modules
In addition to core knowledge, we provide supplementary specific modules that cover:

1. **Individual Secure Data Services:** Modules like GESIS Safe Haven.
2. **Different Types of Data:** For instance, genomics data.
3. **Various Tasks and Roles:** Such as Data Producer.

These supplementary modules enable RDCs to create individualized learning pathways by combining core modules with other required courses.

## Professional Development
Specific courses aimed at RDC staff are designed to enhance their professional development, ensuring they are well-equipped to support researchers and handle sensitive data efficiently.

## Current Status
The modules are currently in development, with a focus on delivering a comprehensive and adaptable learning experience.
