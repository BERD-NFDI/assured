ASSURED training is based on a flexible, modular approach catering to the differing needs of those involved in the wide landscape of research data.

![ASSURED Overview](ASSURED_content_graph.png) 

Our **Core Modules** cover the key knowledge that is indispensable to work with sensitive data safely across research disciplines. These modules include topics such as data citation, lawful data sharing, understanding data access, and how to produce non-disclosive research outputs. These modules are considered to be essential to achieve the Safe Use of research data in accordance with the Five Safes Framework.


**Specialised Modules** - covering services, data or roles - are designed to provide the specific skills needed for distinct applications.  Examples include:

• **Service Module**: Conducting research within a particular secure environment, such as the GESIS Safe Haven.

• **Data Module**: Understanding the particular challenges of different data types, such as genetic data, medical data, or qualitative data.

• **Role Module**: Developing expertise for a specific professional function, such as a researcher, data access professional, policy maker or data producer.

See the list of available modules on our e-learning platform: [ https://platform.assured-training.org/](https://platform.assured-training.org/)

All ASSURED modules are conveyed via short (about 10 minutes) and compact learning units. The programme also includes interactive activities and assessments to test understanding. This modular structure enables Research Data Centres and trainees to create individual learning pathways for their researchers and professional staff by combining the Core Modules with those Specialised Modules that best suit their requirements for accessing data or for their professional development ambitions.
