# ASSURED Modules 

{% page_lead() %}
ASSURED is an adaptable online training with several modules types that cover different needs.
{% end %}


Our **core modules** represent a minimum standard that is expected of researchers and professional staff wherever they access and handle sensitive data. The completion of the core modules provides researchers with a standardized accreditation recognised across Research Data Centres in Germany. 

Beyond the basic knowledge we offer supplementary **specific modules** for
1. **Individual Secure Data Services** like GESIS Safe Haven
2. Different **Types of Data** (e.g. genomics data)
3. Various **Tasks and Roles** such as Data Producer.

This enables Research Data Centres to create individual learning pathways for their researchers and professional staff by combining the core modules with other required modules and courses. 

Additionally, the specific courses targeted at Research Data Centre staff are designed to better support their professional development.


The modules are currently in development. To get an idea of how the contents will look like, we invite you watch the video on the Five Safes Framework:
