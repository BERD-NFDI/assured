# Our aim: Safety

{% page_lead() %}
Training the research community in the safe and ethical use of sensitive research data.

## What is our vision?

ASSURED aims to provide training for the safe and ethical use of sensitive, potentially disclosive data for the research community. Through this training, we want to help prepare researchers to work with these data and also help those who work in Trusted Research Environments to gain recognition for their expertise.

## How did Assured come together?

The project started in May 2022 following a meeting of Trusted Research Environments from Germany and the UK. The meeting aimed to address one of the common challenges we face - that researchers applying to use the data often have little training and knowledge of how to work with these data safely. In the UK, dedicated training exists for researchers which has had a positive impact. **Here at ASSURED we want to bring this training to the German research community (and beyond!).**

Originally called the Safe Researcher Accreditation System (SaRAS), we are now developing the Accrediting Safe Research Environments (ASSURED) programme, a full suite of e-Learning modules designed to meet the needs of both researchers and TRE teams across different services and domains.

Over time we hope to expand ASSURED to include modules for other stakeholders, but for now we look forward to sharing our progress over the coming months.
